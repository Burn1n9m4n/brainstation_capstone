# Synesthete: A Music Recommendation System
============================================

This is a git repo for my BrainStation course capstone entitled Synesthete.

### Project Overview
**synesthete** ***(sĭn′ĭs-thēt″)*** - noun

A person who experiences synesthesia, a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway
leads to involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway.

There are many music recommendation systems out there and many of them utilize sophisticated algorithms to achieve high 
accuracy or leverage data gathered from the user over time in order to provide realistic suggestions. Synesthete is a
unique recommendation engine that will provide immediate feedback to a user based on a audio sample provided immediately
using no past information. The method by which it will do this is novel as well as it utilizes an audio encoder to change
the data from auditory information to a spectrographic image. This image is then used as the input for a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to provide recommendations to the user based on image similarity. 

And thus, Synesthete, is born. A deep learning engine that sees sound.
