## Meeting with Paul 7/13/2023
* Concept of distance between two elements
    * Distance between items or users
    * What would make my Spotify related recommender different?
* Things that are more interesting
    * Word embeddings - arithmatic on words and sentences
    * Recommendation engine - Based on cover art (How would we validate this?)
        * Could use a CNN
        * How many playlists do I find these songs embedded on? - Expected value vs Actual
            * Co-occurences
        * Could also do a CNN for audio embedding
* Check if API has the ability to recommend ideas as a point of comparison
* They would send course material to me early so that I could get to work
* Data would end up in a latent space defined entirely by me
* Hugging face transformers for sound and video libraries
* Next Steps: 
    * If we wanted to stick to Spotify
    * Create a DataFrame with the links to audio data or album art
    * 10,000 songs to start for some Deep Learning/CNN applications
    * Check Spotify dataset on Kaggle to check what information is already out there
        * Data set of 10,000 most popular songs on Spotify, for example
        * datasetsearch on Google
